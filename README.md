# Data Visualization Course Tutorial

In this tutorial I will be covering HTML, JS and D3.js for creating data visualization.

## HTML
HTML is the popular language to create websites. 

Important concepts to learn in HTML are:
* Tags (`<html>`, `<body>`, `<head>`, etc)
* Styles
* *Classes
* *IDs

## JavaScript(JS)
HTML alone can only create static websites. Hence, JS is used to augment webpages. JS is the scripting language for websites. JS can be used for many purposes - connecting to website server backend, handle user interaction on the webpage, etc. There are many functionalities we can add to our website by using JS libraries (like [D3.js](https://d3js.org), [Three.js](https://threejs.org), [p5.js](https://p5js.org)). 

Important concepts to learn in JS are:
* variables
* arrays
* loops
* functions

## D3.js
D3.js is the most popular JS library for data visualization on web. In the tutorial, I will teach how to create visualization using D3 and publish them online. Useful concepts to learn in D3 are:
* Append SVG to HTML elements
* D3 Primitives
* Interactions
* Transitions
* .enter(data)
* Importing data files
* *Maps
* *Path
